## TFCSSC Repository Overview

### Project Description
The TFCSSC project is a C implementation that demonstrates two fundamental data structures: a binary tree and a trie. It provides functionalities for insertion and deletion as well as traversal methods for the binary tree and basic trie operations, making it a valuable resource for engineers looking to understand and manipulate these structures effectively.

### Main Components
1. **Binary Tree Implementation**:
   - The binary tree is represented through a structure called , which encompasses an integer key, priority, and pointers to its left, right, and parent nodes.
   - Key operations included:
     - **Insertion**: Adds a new node to the tree with a specified key and priority, ensuring the tree remains balanced.
     - **Deletion**: Removes a node from the tree and rebalances afterward.
     - **Traversal Methods**: Includes in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal functions to display the structure's contents.
     - **Balancing**: Rot
